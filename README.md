### Help Me/Pay Me to Use, Improve, and Extend

Note:  this is a working [`htmlwidget`](http://htmlwidgets.org) first [released](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog/2015/1/30/week-04-interactive-parallel-coordinates-1) in the [Building Widgets](http://buildingwidgets.org) htmlwidget-a-week project.  `parcoords` has already seen extensive use in many projects across multiple domains.  If you have any interest in collaborating with me on this project or applying `parcoords`, please let me know (see [Time Isn't Money](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog/2016/2/12/time-isnt-money)).
